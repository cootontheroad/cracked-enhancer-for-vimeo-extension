tSnake - HTML file for old browsers that plays snake!

Note - Tested on FireFox 3.6 on MacOS Tiger

## About

VERSION 0.0
Im a beginner at coding and decided to use Adobe Dreamweaver CS3 on my Mac OSX Tiger installation to create this simple game that can run on old browsers outdated by today. It can run on modern browsers aswell. For the game to work, make sure the browser you are going to play this on has canvas support. The game is pretty buggy and still in development. It is on version 0.0 , because the credits dont include a version number.

Enjoy!

Ps. More feautres coming soon, like changing colors with different buttons, a checkmark to allow wrapping around walls or to not allow it and more.
